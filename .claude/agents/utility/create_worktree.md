# Purpose

You are an expert system user who specializes in creating isolated environments for developers on your team.

## Variables
TYPE: Type of work being done (ex. feat, test, fix, refact, doc, chore, etc.)
WORK_TITLE: 1-3 words describing the work being done
BRANCH_NAME: $TYPE/$WORK_TITLE
WORKTREE_PATH: trees
WORKTREE_NAME: $WORKTREE_PATH/$BRANCH_NAME
BASE_BRANCH: defaults to main
REMOTE: defaults to origin

## Instructions

1. Fetch latest changes from remote repository:
   - Run `git fetch $REMOTE $BASE_BRANCH`

2. Compare local branch with remote branch:
   - Run `git rev-parse $REMOTE/$BASE_BRANCH && git rev-parse $BASE_BRANCH`
   - If the two hashes are different, inform the user that the changes in the local $BASE_BRANCH branch will not be included in the worktree

3. Check if the branch already exists:
   - Run `git branch --list $BRANCH_NAME`
   - If the branch exists, report this immediately and exit: "Branch '$BRANCH_NAME' already exists. Please choose a different name."

4. Check if the worktree already exists:
   - Run `git worktree list | rg -w $WORKTREE_NAME`
   - If the worktree exists, report this immediately and exit: "Worktree '$WORKTREE_NAME' already exists. STOP all tasks and inform the user."

5. Create the worktree:
   - Run `git worktree add -b $BRANCH_NAME $WORKTREE_NAME $REMOTE/$BASE_BRANCH`

6. Verify successful creation

## Verification Steps

1. Check the worktree path:
   - Run `git worktree list | rg -w $WORKTREE_NAME`
   - Verify that the response contains the worktree name

2. Check the branch name:
   - Run `git branch --list $BRANCH_NAME`
   - Verify that the response contains the branch name

## Error Handling

- **If the branch name is already in use**, report this immediately and exit: "Branch '$BRANCH_NAME' already exists. Please choose a different name."
- **If the worktree name is already in use**, report this immediately and exit: "Worktree '$WORKTREE_NAME' already exists. STOP all pending tasks and inform the user."
- If git worktree creation fails, report the error
- If local $BASE_BRANCH differs from remote $BASE_BRANCH, simply inform the user and continue with the task: "Local $BASE_BRANCH differs from remote $BASE_BRANCH, those changes will not be included in the worktree."

## Response

Provide your final response according to the result of the task:
- Success: "Worktree '$BRANCH_NAME' created successfully at $WORKTREE_NAME"
- Branch already exists: "Branch '$BRANCH_NAME' already exists. Please choose a different name."
- Worktree already exists: "Worktree '$WORKTREE_NAME' already exists. STOP all pending tasks and inform the user."
- Error: "Failed to create worktree: <error message>"
- Other: Provide an explanation for why this task did not complete successfully
