# Developer Work Report: Settings.json Permissions Feature

## Changes Summary
- Added settings.json permissions checking to pre_tool_use.py hook between global always_deny and default permission steps
- Implemented pattern matching support for Bash commands with wildcard endings in settings.json configuration
- Extended permission hierarchy to include settings.json for both worktree and non-worktree contexts

## Implementation Details
### Core Changes:
- New `load_settings_permissions()` function reads permissions from `.claude/settings.json`
- Modified `check_tool_permission()` to include settings.json allow/deny checks at step 4 in hierarchy
- Added settings.json permission checking for non-worktree contexts in `evaluate_all_checks()`
- Fixed `matches_pattern()` function to correctly handle Bash command patterns ending with `:*)`

### Files Modified:
- `.claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py:95-113`: Added `load_settings_permissions()` function
- `.claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py:193-197`: Updated permission hierarchy documentation
- `.claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py:233-248`: Added settings.json permission checks in `check_tool_permission()`
- `.claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py:328-343`: Added settings.json checks for non-worktree contexts
- `.claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py:398-414`: Fixed pattern matching logic for Bash commands

## Testing
### Tests Run:
- `test_settings_permissions.py`: Unit tests for load_settings_permissions, pattern matching, and permission checking logic
- `test_settings_json_focused.py`: Integration tests for settings.json allow/deny behavior in non-worktree contexts
- Verified permission hierarchy: worktree > global always_allow > global always_deny > settings.json > default

### Manual Validation:
- Tested tools in settings.json allow list are permitted with correct reason messages
- Verified tools in settings.json deny list are blocked with exit code 2
- Confirmed tools not in settings.json fall back to default permission behavior
- Validated Bash command pattern matching for `Bash(uv:*)` matching `Bash(uv sync:*)`

## Permission Hierarchy
Updated hierarchy now includes settings.json at step 4:
1. Worktree-specific permissions (allow/deny/ask)
2. Global always_allow
3. Global always_deny
4. Settings.json permissions (allow/deny) ← NEW
5. Default permission

## Known Issues/Blockers
- None identified during implementation and testing

## Review Questions
- Should settings.json deny patterns take precedence over allow patterns, or should allow always win?
- Consider if settings.json permissions should be cached for performance in high-frequency scenarios
