# Developer Work Report: Code Review Agent

## Changes Summary
- Created new sub-agent `code-review-agent` for systematic feature review with weighted rubric evaluation
- Implemented test suite with sample documents demonstrating agent's review capabilities
- Configured agent with document-driven review process and structured output formats

## Implementation Details
### Core Changes:
- Designed rubric-based evaluation system with 4 importance tiers (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Implemented 3-document requirement pattern (style guide, design brief, developer report)
- Configured restricted tool access (Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Edit) with Edit limited to test files only
- Created conditional output formatting based on review results (pass/fail/validation)

### Files Modified:
- `.claude/agents/code-review-agent.md`: Full agent configuration with system prompt
- `tests/feat/code-review-agent/sample_style_guide.md`: Python coding standards document
- `tests/feat/code-review-agent/sample_design_brief.md`: User auth system requirements
- `tests/feat/code-review-agent/sample_developer_report.md`: Implementation details report
- `tests/feat/code-review-agent/test_review_scenario.py`: Sample code with intentional issues
- `tests/feat/code-review-agent/README.md`: Test suite documentation

## Testing
### Tests Run:
- Validated agent markdown syntax and frontmatter configuration
- Created comprehensive test scenario with multiple review failure points
- Verified test Python file executes: `python test_review_scenario.py`

### Manual Validation:
- Agent file follows Claude Code sub-agent format specification
- Test documents provide complete context for review process
- Sample code contains identifiable issues across all rubric categories

## Known Issues/Blockers
- Agent not yet tested in live environment (requires merge to main)
- No integration tests with actual Claude Code delegation
- Rate limiting implementation details not specified in rubric

## Review Questions
- Should agent support reviewing non-Python codebases (current examples are Python-focused)?
- Is Edit tool access to test files sufficient, or should it be read-only?
- Should rubric weights be configurable per project?

## Additional Context
- Agent uses purple color and sonnet model for optimal performance
- Rubric weighted scoring: Critical (9-10), High (7-8), Medium (4-6), Low (2-3)
- Test scenario includes 10+ identifiable issues for validation
