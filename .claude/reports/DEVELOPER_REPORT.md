# Developer Work Report

## Changes Summary
- Implemented granular tool permissions control for Claude Code worktrees with configurable Allow/Ask/Deny decisions
- Added pattern-based permission matching for different worktree types (dev, main, feature, test, etc.)
- Enhanced pre_tool_use hook to detect worktree environments and enforce security policies

## Implementation Details
### Core Changes:
- Added worktree detection via `cwd` field parsing (`worktree_BRANCHNAME` pattern)
- Implemented hierarchical permission system: global deny/allow rules → worktree-specific → pattern-based → defaults
- Created structured YAML configuration with global settings, named worktrees, and regex patterns
- Added comprehensive tool identifier formatting for bash commands and file operations

### Files Modified:
- `.claude/hooks/config/worktree-permissions.yaml`: New configuration file with permission rules for different worktree types
- `.claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py`: Added 8 new functions for worktree detection, permission checking, and pattern matching
- `test_worktree_permissions.py`: Comprehensive test suite validating all permission scenarios

## Testing
### Tests Run:
- 6 test scenarios covering regular directories, named worktrees, pattern matching, and security rules
- Validated exit codes: 0 (allow), 1 (ask), 2 (deny)
- Confirmed JSON output format matches Claude Code hook specification

### Manual Validation:
- Tested worktree_dev permissions (Write: Allow, git commands: Allow)
- Tested worktree_main permissions (Write: Ask, git push: Deny)
- Validated global security rules (sudo commands blocked)
- Confirmed pattern matching for feature branch names

## Dependencies
### Added:
- `pyyaml`: Already present in script dependencies for YAML config parsing
- `typing`: Standard library imports for type hints

## Known Issues/Blockers
- None identified. All core functionality working as expected.

## Review Questions
- Should we add more granular bash command parsing (e.g., distinguish between `git push origin` vs `git push origin main`)?
- Consider adding time-based permissions (e.g., disable production writes outside business hours)?

## Additional Context
- Hook maintains backward compatibility with existing .env and dangerous command blocking
- Permission logging integrates with existing log infrastructure in `logs/pre_tool_use.json`
- Pattern-based rules support regex matching for dynamic branch naming conventions
- Exit code behavior aligns with Claude Code hook standards for tool control
