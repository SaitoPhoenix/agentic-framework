# Developer Work Report Example

## Changes Summary
- Implemented JWT-based authentication system with refresh token rotation
- Added rate limiting middleware for API endpoints
- Created user session management with Redis cache

## Implementation Details
### Core Changes:
- JWT token generation with RS256 algorithm, 15min access / 7d refresh expiry
- Rate limiter using sliding window algorithm (100 req/min default)
- Session store abstraction supporting Redis/memory backends

### Files Modified:
- `src/auth/jwt_handler.py:12-145`: JWT generation, validation, refresh logic
- `src/middleware/rate_limiter.py:1-89`: Rate limiting middleware implementation
- `src/cache/session_store.py:23-67`: Redis session management interface
- `src/api/auth_routes.py:45-112`: Login/logout/refresh endpoints
- `config/settings.py:78-82`: Added AUTH_SECRET_KEY, REDIS_URL env vars

## Testing
### Tests Run:
- `uv run pytest tests/auth/` - 42 tests, 100% coverage
- `uv run pytest tests/middleware/test_rate_limiter.py` - 15 tests passed
- Load test: 10k concurrent requests, p99 latency 45ms

### Manual Validation:
- Token refresh flow verified with Postman collection
- Rate limiting confirmed at 100/min threshold with 429 responses
- Redis failover to in-memory cache tested by killing Redis container

## Dependencies
### Added:
- `pyjwt@2.8.0`: JWT encoding/decoding
- `redis@5.0.1`: Session storage backend
- `cryptography@41.0.7`: RS256 support for JWT

## Known Issues/Blockers
- Redis connection pool exhaustion at >5k concurrent sessions (tracking in #457)
- Token revocation list grows unbounded - needs TTL cleanup job

## Review Questions
- Should we implement token fingerprinting for added security?
- Rate limit configuration per-endpoint vs global setting?
- Preferred approach for handling Redis downtime: failover to memory or reject requests?

## Additional Context
- Breaking change: API clients must include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Migration required: existing sessions invalidated, users must re-authenticate
