## Preferences

### Documentation
- Prefers comprehensive documentation in dedicated README files with better formatting [251003_EP_7]
- Wants all task options documented in one central location for reusability [251003_EP_7]
- Values clear examples showing actual configuration usage [251003_EP_7]

### Code Organization
- Prefers modular, reusable tasks over monolithic scripts [251003_EP_7]
- Favors file-based configuration over inline configuration [251003_EP_7]
- Likes configuration organized by permission levels for clarity [251003_EP_7]

### Testing Approach
- Tests implementations incrementally with specific scenarios [251003_EP_7]
- Provides direct bash commands for testing rather than descriptions [251003_EP_7]
- Tests edge cases systematically (e.g., different path formats) [251003_EP_7]
- Requests comprehensive test coverage for all security rules [251006_EP_2]
- Values efficient parallel test execution when possible [251006_EP_2]
- Expects detailed summaries of test results with coverage analysis [251006_EP_2]

### Execution Environment
- Always uses uv for running Python scripts [251006_EP_2]
- Insists on proper tool usage rather than alternatives like python3 [251006_EP_2]

## Patterns

### Communication Style
- Provides clear, specific requirements before implementation begins [251003_EP_7]
- Asks for evaluation and analysis before making changes [251003_EP_7]
- Tests implementations immediately after completion [251003_EP_7]
- Provides corrective feedback when behavior doesn't match expectations [251003_EP_7]
- Gives concise directives with specific goals [251006_EP_2]
- Points out important contextual information (e.g., current working directory) [251006_EP_2]

### Decision Making
- Makes pragmatic choices (3 larger tasks vs 5 granular ones) [251003_EP_7]
- Focuses on completing one component fully before moving to others [251003_EP_7]
- Defers certain implementations to avoid scope creep [251003_EP_7]
- Requests phased implementation with clear deliverables [251006_EP_2]
- Validates each phase before proceeding to next [251006_EP_2]

### Requirements Specification
- Asks for comprehensive coverage of configured rules [251006_EP_2]
- Requests recommendations after testing completion [251006_EP_2]
- Wants both test results and actionable insights [251006_EP_2]
- Approves proceeding to next phases after validation [251006_EP_2]

## Philosophies

### Security Design
- Security rules should be transparent with no hidden logic [251003_EP_7]
- Configuration should be easily understandable by users [251003_EP_7]
- Literal path matching is preferred with explicit regex when needed [251003_EP_7]

### Software Development
- Complete one feature thoroughly before starting another [251003_EP_7]
- Documentation should be comprehensive and well-structured [251003_EP_7]
- Configuration should be centralized and reusable [251003_EP_7]

### Testing Philosophy
- Test coverage should be comprehensive and systematic [251006_EP_2]
- Edge cases must be included in test suites [251006_EP_2]
- Test efficiency matters - run in parallel when possible [251006_EP_2]

## Approaches

### Project Management
- Uses phased implementation approach with clear milestones [251006_EP_2]
- Validates deliverables before authorizing next phase [251006_EP_2]
- Provides context and constraints upfront [251006_EP_2]
