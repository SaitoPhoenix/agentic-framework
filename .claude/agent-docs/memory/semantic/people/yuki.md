- Asks clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous [251003_EP_7]
- Tests implementations thoroughly with multiple scenarios [251003_EP_7]
- Fixes issues iteratively based on test results [251003_EP_7]
- Implements solutions in phases with clear milestones [251006_EP_2]
- Validates each phase before proceeding to the next [251006_EP_2]

### Communication Style
- Provides comprehensive evaluations with strengths and weaknesses [251003_EP_7]
- Uses structured formatting with clear sections and bullet points [251003_EP_7]
- Explains technical decisions with reasoning [251003_EP_7]
- Confirms understanding before proceeding with implementation [251003_EP_7]
- Provides detailed summaries at completion of each phase [251006_EP_2]
- Uses tables and formatted reports for presenting results [251006_EP_2]

### Problem-Solving Method
- Analyzes existing code before proposing changes [251003_EP_7]
- Identifies root causes of issues through debugging [251003_EP_7]
- Proposes multiple solution options with trade-offs [251003_EP_7]
- Implements fixes incrementally with testing at each step [251003_EP_7]
- Uses systematic debugging when issues arise (e.g., path resolution problems) [251006_EP_2]
- Tests hypotheses with small debug scripts before implementing fixes [251006_EP_2]

### Testing Approach
- Creates comprehensive test suites with multiple categories [251006_EP_2]
- Tests core functionality before edge cases [251006_EP_2]
- Runs tests in parallel when dependencies allow [251006_EP_2]
- Provides detailed test reports with statistics and categorization [251006_EP_2]
- Documents both passing and failing tests with clear explanations [251006_EP_2]

## Approaches

### Documentation Creation
- Structures documentation with clear sections and examples [251003_EP_7]
- Includes both conceptual explanations and practical examples [251003_EP_7]
- Provides troubleshooting sections for common issues [251003_EP_7]
- Uses markdown formatting for better readability [251003_EP_7]

### Code Quality
- Writes modular, reusable code components [251003_EP_7]
- Implements comprehensive error handling [251003_EP_7]
- Adds detailed comments and docstrings [251003_EP_7]
- Follows established patterns and conventions [251003_EP_7]

### Test Design
- Organizes tests by category and priority [251006_EP_2]
- Creates metadata-rich test payloads [251006_EP_2]
- Implements multiple validation strategies for different output types [251006_EP_2]
- Provides backward compatibility with legacy test formats [251006_EP_2]
- Generates both machine-readable and human-readable reports [251006_EP_2]

### Migration Strategy
- Automates test migration with validation rules defined in code [251006_EP_2]
- Enriches migrated tests with comprehensive metadata [251006_EP_2]
- Validates migrated tests match expected behavior [251006_EP_2]
- Handles edge cases where current behavior differs from ideal [251006_EP_2]

## Accomplishments

### Hook Test Framework (Phase 1-4)
- Designed and implemented comprehensive test framework for Claude Code hooks [251006_EP_2]
- Created test discovery system with flexible filtering [251006_EP_2]
- Implemented multiple validation strategies (json, exitcode, text) [251006_EP_2]
- Built report generation system with JSON and Markdown outputs [251006_EP_2]
- Successfully migrated 57 security guard tests to new format [251006_EP_2]
- Achieved 100% test pass rate after migration [251006_EP_2]

### Test Coverage
- Created 4 whitelist test payloads [251006_EP_2]
- Created 20 deny test payloads [251006_EP_2]
- Created 10 ask test payloads [251006_EP_2]
- Created 12 edge case test payloads [251006_EP_2]
- Created 11 future enhancement test payloads [251006_EP_2]
- Organized all tests with metadata, categories, tags, and priorities [251006_EP_2]

## Philosophies

### Phased Implementation
- Break complex projects into clear phases with deliverables [251006_EP_2]
- Validate each phase before proceeding [251006_EP_2]
- Document accomplishments and next steps at each phase boundary [251006_EP_2]

### Testing Philosophy
- Comprehensive test coverage across all scenarios [251006_EP_2]
- Test both expected behaviors and edge cases [251006_EP_2]
- Document future enhancements as tests [251006_EP_2]
