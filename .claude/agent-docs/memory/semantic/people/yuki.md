- Adds missing validation checks (cwd existence) [251008_EP_7]
- Removes double-prefixing artifacts in output [251008_EP_7]

## Approaches

## Philosophies

### Phased Implementation
- Break complex projects into clear phases with deliverables [251006_EP_2]
- Validate each phase before proceeding [251006_EP_2]
