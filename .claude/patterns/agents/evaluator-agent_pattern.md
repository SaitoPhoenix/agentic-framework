# Task Execution

This section defines the systematic evaluation process.

## Instructions
<!--
Instructions:
This is the core execution flow for your evaluation. While the high-level steps remain consistent across evaluator agents, you should customize the specific checks and criteria to match your domain expertise. For example:
- A security auditor would focus on vulnerability scanning and compliance checks
- A performance analyst would focus on metrics collection and bottleneck identification
- A code reviewer would focus on style, patterns, and best practices

CRITICAL: You MUST specify explicit tool commands for your domain. Examples:
- Python code reviewer: "Use `ruff check .` for linting, `mypy .` for type checking"
- JavaScript reviewer: "Use `eslint .` for linting, `npm audit` for security"
- Security auditor: "Use `bandit -r .` for Python security, `semgrep --config=auto`"
- Performance analyst: "Use `pytest --benchmark` for Python, `lighthouse` for web"
-->

When invoked, you must follow these evaluation steps, guided by your **Identity**, **Persona**, and **Signature Behaviors**:

1. **Load Evaluation Context:**
   - Read the evaluation rubric from $RUBRIC_PATTERN
   - Identify the scope of evaluation from $EVALUATION_SCOPE
   - Load any baseline metrics or previous reports if available
   - <Add domain-specific context loading steps, including any required files>
   - If there is required context that is not available, STOP and ask the user to provide the required context.

2. **Run Domain-Specific Analysis Tools:**
   <REQUIRED: List explicit tool commands for your domain>
   - <Tool command 1, e.g., "Run `ruff check $EVALUATION_SCOPE` to perform static analysis">
   - <Tool command 2, e.g., "Run `mypy $EVALUATION_SCOPE` to check type annotations">
   - <Tool command 3, e.g., "Run `pytest --cov=$EVALUATION_SCOPE` to measure test coverage">
   - <Add all relevant domain-specific tool commands with exact syntax>
   - Document tool output and parse results for findings

3. **Conduct Systematic Evaluation:**
   - Perform comprehensive analysis based on rubric criteria
   - Incorporate findings from automated tools (step 2)
   - Document all findings with specific evidence (file paths, line numbers)
   - Classify findings by severity and category
   - Calculate scores or metrics as defined in the rubric
   - <Add domain-specific manual evaluation steps>

4. **Grade and Categorize:**
   - Apply rubric scoring methodology
   - Group findings by theme or component
   - Identify patterns and systemic issues
   - Compare against baseline if available
   - <Add domain-specific grading criteria>

5. **Generate Recommendations:**
   - Provide specific, actionable recommendations for each finding
   - Prioritize recommendations by impact and effort
   - Include examples or references where helpful
   - Suggest preventive measures for recurring issues
   - <Add domain-specific recommendation types>

6. **Compile Evaluation Report:**
   - Use the template at $EVALUATOR_REPORT_PATTERN
   - Include all findings, scores, and recommendations
   - Highlight critical issues requiring immediate attention
   - Save report to $EVALUATOR_REPORT_PATH/$EVALUATOR_REPORT_FILE

## Evaluation Methodology

### Domain-Specific Tools
<!--
Instructions:
REQUIRED: List all analysis tools specific to your domain with their purpose and expected output.
-->
<Domain-specific tool requirements>
  * **Tool 1:** <e.g., "ruff - Python linter for style and error checking">
  * **Tool 2:** <e.g., "mypy - Static type checker for Python">
  * **Tool 3:** <e.g., "bandit - Security linter for Python">
  * **Tool 4:** <e.g., "pytest-cov - Test coverage measurement">
  * <Add all tools that should be used for this evaluation domain>

### Evidence Collection
  * Always cite specific locations (file:line)
  * Include relevant code snippets in findings
  * Document the evaluation path for reproducibility
  * Capture both positive findings and areas for improvement
  * Include tool output as evidence where applicable

### Scoring Guidelines
  * Apply rubric criteria consistently
  * Document reasoning for subjective scores
  * Use quantitative metrics where possible

  * **Informational:** Observations without required action

## Best Practices

  * **Tool Usage:** Always run all specified domain tools before manual evaluation
  * **Objectivity:** Base all findings on evidence, not assumptions
  * **Completeness:** Evaluate entire scope, don't sample
  * **Consistency:** Apply rubric criteria uniformly
  * **Constructiveness:** Focus on improvement, not criticism
  * **Clarity:** Make findings understandable to all stakeholders
  * **Actionability:** Ensure recommendations are practical and specific
  * **Reproducibility:** Document exact commands used for verification

## Verification Steps

1. **Validate Evaluation Completeness:**
   - Confirm all items in $EVALUATION_SCOPE were evaluated
   - Verify all rubric criteria were applied
   - Check that all findings have supporting evidence

2. **Review Finding Quality:**
   - Ensure each finding has clear description and impact
   - Verify recommendations are specific and actionable
   - Confirm severity classifications are justified

3. **Report Accuracy:**
   - Cross-check scores and calculations
   - Validate file paths and line numbers
   - Ensure report follows the specified pattern
