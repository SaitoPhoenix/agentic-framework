# Architecture Specification: [project_name]

## Overview and Architectural Goals
<!--
Example:
* **Scalability:** The system must support 10,000 concurrent users within the first year.
* **Maintainability:** Services should be loosely coupled to allow for independent development and deployment.
* **Security:** Adherence to OWASP Top 10 principles is mandatory. No sensitive PII should be stored in logs.
* **Reliability:** The core services must maintain 99.95% uptime.
-->

## Architectural Principles & Constraints
<!--
Example:
* **Microservices:** The system will be composed of single-responsibility microservices.
* **Asynchronous Communication:** Services must communicate asynchronously via a message bus (`Kafka`) for all non-blocking operations.
* **Stateless Services:** All backend services must be stateless to allow for horizontal scaling. State should be managed in the database or a distributed cache.
* **API-First:** All services must expose functionality through versioned, RESTful APIs documented with OpenAPI specs.

    C -> D(Auth Service);
    C -> E(Transaction Service);
    C -> F(Reporting Service);
    E -> G((Message Bus - Kafka));
    F -> G;
    E -> H[(Database - PostgreSQL)];
    F -> H;
```

## Component Breakdown
<!--
Example:
* **Web Frontend:** A React single-page application (SPA) responsible for all user interaction.
* **API Gateway:** The single entry point for all client requests. Handles routing, rate limiting, and authentication.
* **Auth Service:** Manages user identity, registration, login, and token generation.
* **Transaction Service:** Handles the ingestion, processing, and categorization of financial transactions.
* **Reporting Service:** Generates financial reports and statements.
* **Message Bus (Kafka):** Event backbone for asynchronous communication between services.
-->

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

Defines the global approach to system-wide issues.
<!--
Example:
* **Logging:** All services will log structured JSON to stdout. Logs will be aggregated by a central service (e.g., Datadog).
* **Monitoring & Alerting:** Each service must expose a /health endpoint. Key metrics (latency, error rate) will be tracked in Prometheus.
* **Authentication & Authorization:** Handled by the Auth Service which issues JWTs. The API Gateway validates tokens on all incoming requests.
