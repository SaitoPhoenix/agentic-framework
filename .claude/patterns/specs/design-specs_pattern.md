Example:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Kafka as Message Bus
    participant CatService as Categorization Service
    participant DB as Database

    Kafka->>+CatService: Event: { transaction_id: 123 }
    CatService->>+DB: SELECT description FROM transactions WHERE id=123
    DB->>-CatService: "STARBUCKS #12345"
    Note right of CatService: ML Model predicts 'Food & Drink'
    CatService->>+DB: UPDATE transactions SET category_id=5 WHERE id=123
    DB->>-CatService: Success
    CatService->>+Kafka: Emit Event: { transaction_id: 123, category: 'Food & Drink' }
    deactivate CatService
