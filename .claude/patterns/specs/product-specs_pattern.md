## Problems to be Solved (User Stories)
<!--
Instructions:
This lists the core problems this product will solve, framed as user stories. This format is ideal for an AI as it clearly links a persona to a need and a motivation.

Examples:
* **US-101:** As **Sam the Small Business Owner**, I want to connect my bank account securely, so that my transactions are imported automatically.
* **US-102:** As **Sam the Small Business Owner**, I want the system to automatically categorize 80% of my expenses, so that I only have to manually review a few transactions.
* **US-103:** As **Freelancer Fiona**, I want to generate a quarterly profit & loss statement in one click, so that I can easily file my estimated taxes.

## Business Goals & Success Metrics
<!--
Instructions:
This section is critical for the AI evaluation agents. It defines what success looks like in quantitative, measurable terms.

| Goal Description                | Metric ID                  | Measurement                                      | Target Value      | Evaluation Method                                 |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |

Examples:
| Achieve strong user adoption    | `user_activation_rate`     | % of signups who connect a bank account within 24h | > 60%             | Query user database for `signup_ts` and `bank_conn_ts`. |
| Ensure the core feature is valuable | `automated_categorization_acc` | % of transactions correctly auto-categorized     | > 80%             | Run evaluation script against a golden dataset of transactions. |
| Retain users long-term          | `user_retention_rate_w4`   | % of new users who are still active in Week 4    | > 30%             | Cohort analysis query on the analytics database.        |
| Drive business success          | `conversion_to_paid_plan`  | % of trial users who upgrade to a paid plan      | > 5%              | Query billing system API.                         |

* Automated expense categorization using a machine learning model.
* Generation of Profit & Loss statements.
* Basic user authentication (email/password).
-->

### Out of Scope (for v1.0):
<!--
Examples:
* International bank accounts.
* Invoice creation and management.
* Payroll processing.
* Multi-user accounts or role-based access control.
-->

## Future Considerations (v1.1 and beyond)
<!--
Instructions:
A brief, forward-looking section to inform architectural decisions. The AI architect agent can use this to design systems that are extensible for future needs without over-engineering the v1.0 product.

Example:
* Potential for multi-user support in v1.1.
* Integration with payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) is a likely next step.
* Exploring a mobile application in the future.
