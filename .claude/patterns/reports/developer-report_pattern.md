# Developer Report

**Agent**: [AGENT_NAME]  
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Task**: [BRIEF_TASK_DESCRIPTION]  
**Branch**: [BRANCH_NAME]  
**Status**: [Completed | Partial | Blocked]

## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentences summarizing what was accomplished. Focus on business value and overall impact. This is what management reads first.]

Example:
```
Implemented comprehensive validation schemas for the webhook processing pipeline, ensuring 
type safety across 3 consuming services. This prevents malformed data from reaching 
production systems and provides clear error messages for debugging.
```

## Changes Overview

### New Implementations
[List new files/modules created with their purpose]

Example:
- `app/schemas/webhook_events.py` - CloudEvents-compliant webhook validation
- `app/schemas/payment_models.py` - Payment processing models with PCI compliance

### Modified Components
[List existing files that were changed and why]

Example:
- `app/api/webhooks.py` - Updated to use new validation schemas
- `app/services/processor.py` - Refactored to handle ValidationErrors

### Removed/Deprecated
[List any components marked for removal or deprecated]

Example:
- `app/models/legacy_webhook.py` - Deprecated, will remove after migration

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions
[Explain key design choices and their rationale]

Example:
```
Chose inheritance pattern for base models to ensure consistent timestamp 
handling across all entities. This reduces code duplication and enforces 
standard audit fields.
```

### Critical Code Patterns
[Show only essential code that demonstrates non-obvious implementations]

```python
# Example - Show only if pattern is non-standard:
@model_validator(mode='after')
def validate_payment_limits(self) -> 'PaymentRequest':
    """Multi-currency validation logic."""
    limits = {"USD": 10000, "EUR": 8500, "GBP": 7500}
    if self.amount > limits.get(self.currency, 10000):
        raise ValueError(f"Exceeds {self.currency} transaction limit")
    return self
```

### Integration Points
[Describe how components connect with existing systems]

Example:
- Schemas integrate with FastAPI for automatic request validation
- Pydantic models serialize directly to JSON for Redis caching
- ValidationErrors are caught by global exception handler

## Impact Analysis

### Direct Dependencies
[List components that directly import/use your code]

Example:
| Component | Impact | Required Action |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| webhook_api | Must update imports | Import new schemas |
| processor_service | Validation behavior changed | Update error handling |
| test_suite | New test fixtures needed | Add validation test cases |

### Downstream Effects
[Describe ripple effects on other systems]

Example:
- API responses now include more detailed validation errors
- Database writes will reject invalid data earlier in pipeline
- Logging format changed to include validation context

### Breaking Changes
[Explicitly list any breaking changes]

Example:
- ⚠️ `WebhookEvent.timestamp` changed from string to integer (Unix epoch)
- ⚠️ `PaymentRequest` now requires `currency` field (was optional)

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage
[Describe what was tested and how]

Example:
```
- Unit tests: 95% coverage on validation logic
- Integration tests: Validated against 3 downstream services
- Edge cases: Tested boundary values, null handling, malformed input
```

### How to Test
[Provide commands or instructions for others to verify]

```bash
# Run validation tests
pytest tests/schemas/test_webhook_events.py -v

# Test integration with API
curl -X POST localhost:8000/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"invalid": "data"}' 
# Should return 422 with validation errors
```

### Test Data Requirements
[Specify any test data or fixtures needed]

Example:
- Valid webhook payloads in `tests/fixtures/webhooks/`
- Invalid cases documented in `tests/fixtures/validation_errors.json`

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
[List known constraints or issues]

Example:
1. Large payload validation (>1MB) has 200ms overhead
2. Recursive validation depth limited to 5 levels
3. Custom error messages not yet localized

### Technical Debt
[Identify areas needing future improvement]

Example:
- TODO: Implement caching for repeated validation patterns
- TODO: Add batch validation support for bulk operations
- FIXME: Error messages could be more user-friendly

## Review Requirements

### Questions for Senior Review

[List specific questions needing architect/lead input]

Example:
1. **Performance**: Is 200ms validation overhead acceptable for large payloads?
2. **Design**: Should we implement schema versioning now or wait for v2?
3. **Security**: Are there additional validation rules needed for PII fields?
4. **Standards**: Does the error message format align with company standards?

### Decisions Needed

[List decisions that need management/architect approval]

Example:
- [ ] Approve breaking change to timestamp format
- [ ] Confirm validation error message structure
- [ ] Decide on schema versioning strategy
- [ ] Review performance impact on high-volume endpoints

### Risk Assessment

[Highlight potential risks]

Example:
- **High**: Breaking change affects 3 production services
- **Medium**: Performance impact on large payload processing
- **Low**: Additional memory usage from validation caching

## Recommendations

### Next Steps
[Suggest follow-up work]

Example:
1. Deploy to staging for integration testing
2. Run load tests to verify performance impact
3. Update API documentation with new validation rules
4. Schedule migration for deprecated schemas

### Required Reviews
[Specify who should review this work]

Example:
- Code Review: Backend team for validation patterns
- Security Review: For PII field handling
- Performance Review: For high-volume endpoint impact
