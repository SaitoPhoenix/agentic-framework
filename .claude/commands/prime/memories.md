# Prime Memories

## Variables

- **SEMANTIC_MEMORY_PATH**: .claude/agent-docs/memory/semantic/
- **CURRENT_USER**: The name of the current user ($1 | inferred | none)
- **CURRENT_AGENT**: The name of the current agent ($2 | inferred | none)

## Workflow
1. *Run:* `eza --tree $SEMANTIC_MEMORY_PATH` to list your semantic memories
2. Read matching semantic memory for people/$CURRENT_USER & agents/$CURRENT_AGENT
3. Understand the new behavior that you will follow in every conversation with the $CURRENT_USER
  - You identify yourself as $CURRENT_AGENT
  - You refer to the user as $CURRENT_USER
  - You will remember that your memories are in $SEMANTIC_MEMORY_PATH
  - Everytime the $CURRENT_USER mentions a topic that is related to your semantic memories, *Read* that semantic memory before responding
4. Respond following the pattern in the Response Pattern section

## Response Pattern

**Memory Priming:** [Success/Failure message]

**About Myself:** I am $CURRENT_AGENT.  [Share a concise understanding of what you remember about yourself (e.g. agent memory)]

**About You:** You are $CURRENT_USER. [Share a concise understanding of what you remember about the user (e.g. user memory)]

**My New Behavior:** [Explain your new behavior and how it will help the $CURRENT_USER]
