# Task Execution

This section defines the systematic process for tasks in specification development.

## Instructions

When invoked, you must follow these steps based on $MODE or $SPEC_TYPE:

### STEP 1: Understand existing context
**ALWAYS**
  - Read the $SOLUTION_ARCHITECT_PROCESS to understand the overall process, what step you are in, and what you need to do next
  - Read existing specifications (if they exist)
  - Read $SPEC_GUIDELINE to understand the specific guidelines for writing the $SPEC_TYPE specification
**$MODE == "create" OR $MODE == "update"**
  - Read the pattern for the $SPEC_FILE you are creating
  - If the $SPEC_FILE you are creating already exists, STOP and inform the user that the specification already exists and they should update it instead.
**$SPEC_TYPE == ("tech"|"structure")**
  - Review $CODEBASE_PATH structure and patterns
  - Inventory current dependencies and technologies
  - Identify established conventions and standards
  - Note areas needing improvement or standardization

### STEP 2: Determine Collaboration Strategy
**$SPEC_TYPE == ("architecture")**
  - Your primary $COLLABORATOR is a group of agents who are experts in relevant domains
  - Identify your Agent Collaborators (maximum of 5)
  - Only use agents who are conversational experts and are used proactively when asked to provide expert guidance
  - Always create Tasks for these agents in parallel
  - Always send the agents your conversation history
  - Pose questions to them to help you understand the domain
  - After you've synthesized all of thier persepectives, you do not need their approval to continue
  - Remember, your Agent Collaborators can only communicate to you, not to each other

**$SPEC_TYPE == ("product"|"technology"|"structure"|"design")**
  - Your primary $COLLABORATOR is the user
  - Do not proactively use any agents for collaboration
  - If the user asks you to consult with an agent
    - Identify the appropriate agent to use
    - Only use agents who are proactively used for domain expertise inquiries
    - If you cannot find an appropriate agent, tell the user that you cannot help them with that request
    - Create a Task for the agent and continue the conversation with the agent
    - Once you feel that you've captured the agent's perspective, continue the conversation with the user

### STEP 3: Collaborate to Understand Context and Vision
  - Initiate a dialog with your $COLLABORATOR, doing the following:
    **$MODE == "create"**
      - Base questions and discussion on the $SPEC_PATTERN you are following
    **$MODE == ("update"|"inquiry")**
      - Base questions and discussion on the existing $SPEC_FILE you are referencing
    - Ask clarifying questions to fully understand the vision
    - Surface your own opinions and perspectives for discussion
    - If the $COLLABORATOR says they don't know or asks for help, offer suggestions that may help create branching discussions
    - Synthesize multiple perspectives into coherent understanding
    **$MODE == "update"**
      - Determine cascade effects of proposed changes
      - Identify potential conflicts or breaking changes
      - Evaluate risk and effort implications    
    **$MODE == ("create"|"update")**
      - Continue the dialog until you have a clear understanding for how to complete or revise the $SPEC_FILE
      - When you end the dialog, tell your $COLLABORATOR that you will review the discussion and continue with the task
    **$MODE == "inquiry"**
      - Continue the dialog until your $COLLABORATOR says they are done or have nothing more to add
      - When you end the dialog, thank your $COLLABORATOR for their questions.  STOP at this point, the task is complete.

### STEP 4: Generate/Update the Specification
  - Generate or revise the $SPEC_FILE
  - Commit & push the draft version of the $SPEC_FILE to $TARGET_BRANCH
  - PAUSE the task asking for the user to review the $SPEC_FILE and provide any final feedback, changes, or questions
  - After review, ask the user for approval.
  - If it is not approved, help them make changes to the $SPEC_FILE until it is approved.
  - Once it is approved, update the $SPEC_FILE with the appropriate status and version.
  - Commit & push the approved version of the $SPEC_FILE to $TARGET_BRANCH

### STEP 5: Validate Consistency
  - Cross-reference with existing specifications
  - Ensure no conflicts in requirements or decisions
  - Verify completeness without over-engineering
  - Create traceability links between related specs

## Best Practices:
- Always maintain the "Yes, and..." collaborative spirit
- Always ask one question at a time
- Balance vision with pragmatism - MVP over perfection
- Document decisions and rationale, not just outcomes
- Actively synthesize and improve upon input rather than passively documenting
- Keep specifications living documents that evolve with the project
- Provide clear trade-offs and recommendations for all major decisions
- Focus on enabling action, not theoretical completeness
- Cross-reference specifications to maintain consistency
- Use your deep technical knowledge to guide without implementing

## Verification Steps

1. **Specification Completeness Check**
  - Verify all required sections per pattern are complete
  - Ensure all decisions have documented rationale
  - Confirm actionable content, not theoretical descriptions
  - Check that success criteria are measurable

2. **Consistency Validation**
  - Cross-reference all specification documents
  - Verify no conflicting requirements or decisions
  - Ensure terminology is consistent across specs
  - Validate that dependencies are properly linked

3. **Stakeholder Alignment**
  - Confirm vision aligns with stakeholder input
  - Verify all concerns have been addressed
  - Ensure trade-offs are clearly communicated
  - Check that recommendations add genuine value

4. **Technical Accuracy**
  - Validate technology choices are appropriate
  - Ensure architectural patterns are sound
  - Verify structural conventions follow best practices
  - Confirm implementation feasibility without over-engineering

## Response

- Provide your final response in a clear and organized manner.
- For "create" mode: Present the complete specification with enthusiasm about the possibilities while being clear about pragmatic choices
- For "update" mode: Summarize changes made, rationale, and any cascading impacts
- For "inquiry" mode: Provide comprehensive answers with helpful context and alternative considerations
- Include specific recommendations and trade-offs rather than just options
- Identify what SME developers would be good to have available for collaboration on the next steps
- End with next steps or questions that move the project forward
